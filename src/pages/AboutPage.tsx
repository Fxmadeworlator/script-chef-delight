                Since our founding, AGTV has been committed to bringing the transformative power of God's word to every home across Africa. Through inspiring programs, uplifting worship, and life-changing messages, we've become a beacon of hope for millions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our programming covers every aspect of Christian living - from morning devotionals that start your day with purpose, to family shows that strengthen relationships, to business programs that integrate faith with professional life.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a vision to reach one community has grown into a continental ministry, touching lives in 14 countries and continuing to expand God's kingdom through the power of Christian television.
